This project was created simply for me to be able to track players progressions in real time.

To be able to see which players are performing at the highest level based on historical data, the data is cummulative so
every gameweek that the script is run it shows total data such as goals, assists, games played etc.

Then visualized plots and summarized tables are used to rank/view teams and players based on various traits
